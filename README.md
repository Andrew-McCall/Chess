> Note: Don't expect any updates. I'm focusing on other projects.

## Description
A chess board app using Java 11 and Swing. Two player only with legal move dectection (Including king check). This was one of my first projects in swing but as I've gotten busy with distractions it's less of a priority for me to finish.
